# Advent of Code 2023

Advent of Code is a yearly coding puzzle that occurs for 25 days in December beginning on December 1st. Check out the 2023 about page for yourself [here](adventofcode.com/2023/about)!

At the moment, my AoC2023 solutions are *currently not optimized.* In order to keep up with the Advent, optimization will come after completion if time is available and optimized solutions will be commented as such.
